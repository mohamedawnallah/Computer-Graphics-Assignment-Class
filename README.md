This code generates a basic visualization of lines and circles using two fundamental algorithms: Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) for line generation and the Midpoint Circle Algorithm for circle generation.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

### Line Drawing (DDA Algorithm)
The `draw_line` function implements the DDA algorithm to draw a line between two points provided as input parameters `x1, y1` (starting point) and `x2, y2` (ending point).
- The function calculates the change in `x` and `y` (dx and dy) to determine the slope of the line.
- It then calculates the number of steps needed to iterate from the starting point to the ending point.
- Using incremental values for `x` and `y`, it generates a list of points along the line and returns these points.


### Circle Drawing (Midpoint Circle Algorithm)
The `plot_circle` function implements the Midpoint Circle Algorithm to draw a circle with a given radius.
- It uses a while loop to calculate points along the circumference of the circle using symmetry properties and the circle equation.
- The algorithm uses a decision parameter `d` to decide the next pixel to plot while traversing the circle.
- It stores the calculated points in a set and later plots them using `plt.scatter`.

### User Interaction
The `main` function allows the user to choose between drawing a line or a circle.
- For drawing a line, the user inputs the starting and ending points.
- For drawing a circle, the user inputs the radius.
- The respective plotting functions are called based on the user's choice, and the plots are displayed using Matplotlib.

### Visualization
The code uses Matplotlib to visualize the generated points as lines or circles based on user input.

This script can be a helpful starting point for understanding these basic graphics algorithms and their implementation in computer graphics. It showcases how lines and circles can be drawn using simple mathematical calculations and iterative approaches.



## Graphics Algorithms Documentation

### Overview

This documentation details the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm for line drawing and the Midpoint Circle Algorithm for circle drawing. These algorithms are utilized in the code to create visualizations of lines and circles.

### Algorithms

#### Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm - Line Drawing

The DDA algorithm is used to draw lines between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` by calculating incremental changes in x and y coordinates.

1. **Calculate Changes in X and Y (dx and dy):**
   - \( \text{dx} = x2 - x1 \)
   - \( \text{dy} = y2 - y1 \)

2. **Determine the Number of Steps:**
   - \( \text{steps} = \max(\lvert \text{dx} \rvert, \lvert \text{dy} \rvert) \)

3. **Calculate Incremental Values:**
   - \( \text{x\_increment} = \frac{\text{dx}}{\text{steps}} \)
   - \( \text{y\_increment} = \frac{\text{dy}}{\text{steps}} \)

4. **Generate Points along the Line:**
   - Iterate from 0 to `steps`.
   - \( x_{i+1} = x_i + \text{x\_increment} \)
   - \( y_{i+1} = y_i + \text{y\_increment} \)
   - Round the coordinates to the nearest integer to obtain discrete points.

#### Midpoint Circle Algorithm - Circle Drawing

The Midpoint Circle Algorithm generates points forming a circle with a given radius.

1. **Initialize Circle Parameters:**
   - \( \text{x} = 0 \)
   - \( \text{y} = \text{radius} \)
   - \( \text{d} = 1 - \text{radius} \)

2. **Calculate Points Using Symmetry:**
   - Iterate while \( \text{x} \leq \text{y} \).
   - Calculate points in eight symmetrical positions using \( (x, y) \), \( (-x, y) \), \( (x, -y) \), \( (-x, -y) \), \( (y, x) \), \( (-y, x) \), \( (y, -x) \), \( (-y, -x) \).
   - Update coordinates based on specific conditions.

3. **Update Decision Parameter:**
   - If \( \text{d} < 0 \), update \( \text{d} \) using \( \text{d} += 2 \times \text{x} + 1 \).
   - If \( \text{d} \geq 0 \), update \( \text{y} \) and \( \text{d} \) using \( \text{y} -= 1 \) and \( \text{d} += 2 \times (\text{x} - \text{y}) + 1 \).

### Code Breakdown

#### Line Drawing (DDA Algorithm)
